SPECTRA REMOTE ADMINISTRATION 


![PREVIEW](https://i.ibb.co/hfYjKS9/af3NFmb.png)

 Architecture
Spectra is a remote access solution that allows
extract valuable information from virtually any computer
with Windows OS.
Spectra is one of the most efficient and well thought out Remote Administration Tool (RAT) programs.

                 Spectra HTTP Protocol 
Ngrok Secure is a service that allows you to open access to the internal resources of the machine on which it is running from an external network by creating a public address, all requests for which will be forwarded to the local address and the specified port.
Ngrok Secure Tunnels allow you to instantly open access to remote systems without touching any of your network settings or opening any ports on your router. This means you get a secure, reliable tunnel for your developer box, IoT device, or just about anything that has access to the internet.
Using ngrok Secure Tunnels means that you can treat every device as being local, even if it's on the other side of the globe.
How secure tunnels works
Ngrok Secure Tunnels work by using a locally installed ngrok agent to establish a connection to the ngrok service. Once the connection is established, you get a public endpoint that you or others can use to access your local service.
When a user hits the public ngrok endpoint, the ngrok edge figures out where to route the request to and forwards it over an encrypted connection to the locally running ngrok agent. From there, the local ngrok agent takes care of sending traffic to your upstream service. The communication between the ngrok edge and agent is secure and encrypted. Traffic from the user to the ngrok edge, and from the ngrok agent to the upstream service rely on the protocol you are using for encryption. For protocols that support end to end encryption using TLS, we provide a TLS tunnel option.
Integrating with Cloud Edge
Ngrok Secure Tunnels are designed to integrate seamlessly into your ngrok Cloud Edge. Each edge has one or more backends which determine how to handle requests to that edge. The Tunnel Group Backend is responsible for forwarding requests to one or more tunnels in the group. A group is created based on a set of labels, where every tunnel with the same set of labels will have requests load balanced across them.
Labeled tunnels are just another tunnel type in the ngrok agent, similar to HTTP or TCP tunnels. When you create a new labeled tunnel, you define the set of labels that identify that tunnel and/or the device it's running on. When you create an edge that includes a tunnel group backend, and configure the tunnel group to look for tunnels matching specific labels, it will find and route traffic to your labeled tunnel.

                 Stub
Stub - Malicious software allegedly provides access to
target computer. However, it is not completely transparent and requires
participation purpose to install on your computer. This type
interaction usually takes the form of several
confirmations before the malware works.

Please note that such malware may be vulnerable to most
commercially available anti-virus and anti-spyware programs.
So they leave marks and quite easily
found on the device
I provide one crypter program which
may prevent your Stub from being detected for a while.
To get the crypter you will need to access the Spectra panel itself to copy your ID
and send me a getsession in messenger
